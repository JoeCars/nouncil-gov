# Nouncil Governance Guidelines

## VOTING

### Voting Options:

All polls in #nouncil-votes have the following options: FOR, AGAINST, or a Nouncillor can abstain from the decision.

### Voting Period:

All Nouncil polls are open for 5 days (120 hours), after which voting will close. Late votes will not be accepted.

### Voting Quorum: 

The minimum number of Nouncillors that need to vote on a proposal in order for a decision to be made. Abstains count towards quorum. A vote that fails to meet quorum is null and void.

Current Voting Quorum: 30%

### Vote Threshold:

In addition to meeting quorum, for a poll to succeed the leading option must have a minimum of 30% support. This includes both FOR and AGAINST options. If the voting threshold is not met the poll is inconclusive.

Current Vote Threshold: 21%

### Changing Votes

If a Nouncillor has voted on a poll and wants to change their vote before it closes they can DM Joel Cares to delete their old vote. This can only be done once per poll, and they are responsible for processing their updated vote.

### Voting Results:

If quorum is not met a poll is inconclusive.

If no option reaches the Vote Threshold the poll is inconclusive.
For example, if we have 100 Nouncillors, a vote option such as FOR needs 30 or more supporting votes to succeed, even if it is the option with the highest votes.

If a poll results in a tie it is inconclusive.
Inconclusive polls will be processed as ABSTAIN in external governance such as Nouns DAO.
If a vote meets quorum, a single vote option has the most votes, and those votes meet or pass the Vote Threshold, that vote option will be considered the winner in a binding Nouncil decision.


## Members

### Member Eligibility:
To be eligible for membership in Nouncil an individual must demonstrate a track record of Nounish Building.

### New Members:
New members can join the Nouncil Discussion Channel at any time and engage in (respectful) dialog and discussion. 

To apply to be a voting Nouncillor fill out the form at: https://form.addressform.io/f/nouncil-apply-for-membership

Once a Month on the 1st of the month, the Nouncil will discuss the Current Waiting list and vote to add eligible new members. 

### Removal of Members: 
Should it be appropriate to remove a member of the Nouncil due to behavior unbecoming a Nouncillor, or project termination, any 2 members of the Nouncil can suggest the removal of said member, which will then be put to a binding Nouncil vote. Removing a Nouncillor requires a majority decision (> 51% of Nouncillors)

### NounsDAO Proposals: 
The Nouncil shall endeavor to discuss and vote on every proposal made at https://nouns.wtf/vote. 

### Prop House
If a Nouncillor has a proposal in a Prop House that Nouncil is voting on they should vote however they want, including for their own proposal.

### Active Nouncillor
An Active Nouncillor is a Nouncillor who has a vote participation rate  of 69% or greater and has been active in Nouncil for at least 2 months.
This status will be used to determine eligibility for various grant programs. For instance, only Active Nouncillors are eligible for the regular Community Grants allocations.

### Minimum Vote Participation Rate
Current Minimum Vote Participation Rate: 10%

If a Nouncillorâ€™s vote participation falls below the minimum they will be automatically removed from Nouncil. They are welcome to apply again at any time, but all Nouncil voting records will start from scratch.



### Presence in Discord
It is not currently possible to participate in Nouncil without being a member of the Nouncil Discord server. As such, leaving the Nouncil Discord is equivalent to resigning from Nouncil.

If a Nouncillor leaves the Nouncil Discord they have 7 days to rejoin and contact an admin to restore their Nouncillor role. After 7 days they will be removed from Nouncil entirely and will need to reapply to join in the future.
